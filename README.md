# Chain of Responsibility and Iterator design patterns
Chain of responsibility and iterator patterns on java in restaurant example.

Using: IntelJ IDEA Community Edition

## Task
1) Write a program that solves a specific task with the Chain of Responsibility pattern.

For example, a multi-functional restaurant in which a request comes in and this request can be handled by a butler, baker, pizza baker, sushi chef, etc. If one can handle the order, then it will execute the order and return the result. And if he cannot fulfill it, then he will transfer this request to someone else.
2) Write some class that contains some set. This set can be represented as a list, array, tree, graph, stack, etc.
Write an iterator generation for such an object. In the main method, create an object of this class, create an iterator from it, and use this iterator to print all passed elements to the console.
